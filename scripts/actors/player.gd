## The teacher. You.
##
## Movement is read through INPUT ACTIONS, never Input.is_physical_key_pressed.
## That distinction is load-bearing: Input.action_press() can drive an action
## from a test, but nothing can fake a physical key press, so the old WASD
## handling was untestable by construction.
